<1> How Program is Complied and Execute in Python.
-Python internally does not Convert Source code into .pyc files.
-PVM will directly execute source code.
-If really want to convert,Use command to convert into byte Code :  python -m py_compile DataTypes.py
-Source Code file (Test.py)====(Compiler)====>ByteCode==(Python Virtual Machine will execute program)

<2> How Variable is stored in Python Memory
- Suppose we have created 3 variables :-
  a-1; a=12.1;a="String";
  It will create 3 different objects in memory.
  Now i is pointing to "String" block.
